We analyze mobility in the Los Angeles area during the spring 2020 coronavirus crisis

Specifically, we aim to compare data for public transport vs. driving vs. rideshare, to see which services suffered most, and in which specific areas or pathway.

The goal is to prepare for the second coronavirus wave in the fall, and have policies in place that minimize the impact of closures.
